HIDDEN GEMS BCN — NO-CODE MAP (STATIC)

WHAT THIS IS
- A ready-to-deploy map site that needs NO developer tools.
- Files: index.html (page), places.geojson (your data).
- Uses free OpenStreetMap tiles; no API keys.

PUBLISH (3 SIMPLE WAYS)
1) Netlify (easiest): go to app.netlify.com → Sites → "Add new site" → "Deploy manually" → drag this folder.
2) Vercel: create a new project → "Import" → drag this folder.
3) GitHub Pages: new repo → upload files → Settings → Pages → select main branch.

UPDATE YOUR PLACES
- Replace 'places.geojson' with a new one (same filename).
- Re-deploy (drag & drop again). Done.

EDIT FILTER BUTTONS
